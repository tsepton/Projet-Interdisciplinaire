### Getting started
### Prerequisite for GTFS and Shapefiles

Because of the size of those files and their short validity over time, you need to download and place them in these folders :

```bash
mkdir data/
mkdir data/gtfs
mkdir data/shapefiles
```


#### With Docker (compose)
```bash
docker-compose up -d # Running the container 
docker-compose down  # Stopping it
```
